# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly).

## Dependencies

- Node.js
- Express
- EJS
- bcryptjs
- body-parser
- cookie-session
- Keygrip

## Getting Started

- Install all dependencies (using the `npm install` command) -- this includes Keygrip, which was not mentioned in Compass but recommended in https://github.com/expressjs/cookie-session.
- Run the development web server using the `node express_server.js` command. Otherwise, you can install nodemon and the server would automatically restart after any saved changes.
- Apologies for lack of design! Haven't covered CSS in class yet
